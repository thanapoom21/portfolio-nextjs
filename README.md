# Welcome to my portfolio

This repo is for showcasing my web developement skills. It is not perfect and it serves as a sandbox. I've tried to implement a lot of tools, library, frameworks, and more.

## Quick Start

Required versions of tools used within this repo:

- Node: lts/gallium -> v16.13.1
- `yarn@1.22.17`
- `git@2.35.0` or greater

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run local development
yarn dev

# Build for deployment
yarn build

# Run production build
yarn start
```

ESlint and Prettier are installed for easy configuration and code format. We can change the configuration later as we see fit.

```sh
# Run lint to see if it complies with code rules or convention.
yarn lint
```
