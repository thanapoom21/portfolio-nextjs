          Hi, I'm Thanapoom and I go by Music. I'm a web developer and a
          translator (English/Thai). You can contact me on Twitter. üçª Cheers, I
          am Fabian, an award winning frontend developer from rural Italy,
          currently living in ~~Sydney~~ on the road. I've worked with and for
          startups like Canva and Spreadshirt, helped companies like DDB
          Worldwide and Munich Airport deliver kick-ass campaigns and cutting
          edge web experiences, judged the best websites around the globe as a
          jury member at awwwards, fucked up my own startup Momate, worked as a
          wedding photographer, created fancy architecture visualisations as a
          3d artist, played the shit out of Dota 2, backpacked 3 months through
          Vietnam with my lovely X100F and hiked 220km through freezing Swedish
          Lapland making friends with reindeers. I guess I like to stay active.
