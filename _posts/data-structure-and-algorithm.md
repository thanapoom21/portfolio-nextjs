## DSA aka Data Structure and Algorithm

By definition, Data structure seems to be simpler and easy to digest than the algorithm. That's because you can memorize common types of how programmers structure their data depending on language used. However, algorithm requires an understanding of data structure and an ability to perform problem-solving operations and calculations by a certain set of rules. 

Here are some common JavaScript data structures: 

- Stack
- Queue
- Array
- Linked List
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Tree
- Trie
- Set
